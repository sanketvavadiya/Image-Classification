## Case study - 1
Binary image classification  
*Dataset_source.ipynb* file creates directories of training, validation and test images  
*Dataset_utils.ipynb* file will be used to initialized X and y of model  
*model_summary.ipynb* is used to plot graph  
1. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data">Download dataset</a>
2. Execute *Dataset_source.ipynb*
3. Then all the models
4. Evaluate model using *model_evalution_utils.py*
